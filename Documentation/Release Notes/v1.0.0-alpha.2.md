v1.0.0-alpha.2 was released on May 11, 2015. It is the third release of
SharpNav and the second pre-release of v1.0.0. It fixes a few bugs from
v1.0.0-alpha.1 and changes some of the pathfinding and crowd APIs.

## Major Changes

  - Added serialization/deserialization API.
    - Implemented a JSON serializer ([PR #36][1]).
  - Started CLI and GUI clients.
  - Introduced the `NavPoint` struct to replace the common `int` and `Vector3`
    pair in pathfinding code.
  - Updated all projects to .NET 4.5.1
  - Started multithreading parts of navmesh generation (Heightfield
    rasterization).

## Minor Changes

  - Added Appveyor as a second continuous integration service.
  - Moved all source code and `SharpNav.sln` to the `Source/` directory.
  - Refactored some values in `NavMeshGenerationSettings`.
  - Most of the functions inside `PathfinderCommon` were refactored to their
    proper classes. The rest of the class was moved into
    `SharpNav.Pathfinding` and renamed to `PathfindingCommon`.

## Bugfixes

  - Fixed several crowd bugs ([PR #30][2]).

## Known Issues

  - CLI client doesn't log a lot of useful things.
  - CLI client only exports JSON file format.
  - GUI client doesn't generate a navmesh.
  - GUI client doesn't have all buttons/menus functional.
  - Edge cases consuming a lot of memory likely still exist.
  - public APIs are still unfinished.
