v1.0.0-alpha.1 was released on December 31, 2014. It is the second release of
SharpNav and the first pre-release of v1.0.0. It fixes several bugs from
v0.9.0 and makes several changes to the public API.

## Major Changes

  - Removed existing but broken XNA and Unity3D builds.
  - Raw contour vertices are no longer stored in the `Contour` class.
  - SharpNav now relies on NuGet to retrieve packages.

## Minor Changes

  - The `RegionId` enum is now the `Region` struct.
  - The `AreaId` enum is now the `Area` struct.
  - All vector types are now in the `SharpNav.Geometry` namespace in the
    Standalone build.
  - The `ContourSet` constructor no longer takes a `CompactHeightfield` as a
    parameter. It is instead handled in `CompactHeightfield.BuildContourSet`.

## Bugfixes

  - Fixed incorrect slope calculation in `AreaIdGenerator`.
  - Fixed most bugs preventing proper triangulation in `PolyMeshDetail`.
  - Fixed thread safety issue with triangle rasterization in `Heightfield`.

## Known Issues

  - With enough detail, `PolyMeshDetail` will still produce incorrectly
    triangulated meshes.
  - Edge cases consuming a lot of memory likely still exist.
  - public APIs are still unfinished.
