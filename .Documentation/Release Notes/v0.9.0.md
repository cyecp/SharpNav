v0.9.0 was released on October 11, 2014 and is the first publicly released
versions of SharpNav. Due to packaging issues, there are two other versions
available on NuGet - v0.9.1 and v0.9.2.

v0.9.1 and v0.9.2 only differ from v0.9.0 in packaging on NuGet. The
assemblies are still versioned as v0.9.0, though.

## Known Issues

  - Bug(s) that prevent proper triangulation in `PolyMeshDetail`
  - Excessive memory usage in rare cases
  - Unfinished public APIs, though the `SharpNav` namespace is mostly stable
